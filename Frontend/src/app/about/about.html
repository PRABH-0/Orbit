      <p>
        Orbit is a <span class="u">visual file management tool</span> designed to help
        users understand and navigate <span class="u">complex folder structures</span>
        without losing context. Instead of relying on long lists and deep directory
        trees, Orbit focuses on showing relationships between folders in a clear and
        intuitive way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Traditional file systems work well for small projects, but as files grow,
        users often feel lost. Navigating deep folders breaks context, makes exploration
        harder, and turns file management into a cognitive task rather than a natural
        action. Orbit exists to solve this exact problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        The core idea behind Orbit is simple:
        <strong><span class="u">keep structure visible at all times</span></strong>.
        Orbit follows a <span class="u">visual-first</span> approach where folders are
        treated as connected visual entities rather than isolated items in a list.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the center of Orbit is a <span class="u">private root directory</span>.
        From there, folders expand outward, preserving hierarchy while keeping the user
        oriented. Users can explore deeply without ever losing their sense of place.
      </p>

      <p>
  Orbit is built for developers, students, designers, and anyone who works with
  structured data and values <span class="u">clarity</span> over clutter—especially
  when understanding structure matters more than simply opening files.
</p>

<p>
  <span class="u">Security</span> is a core principle of Orbit. Each user operates
  within an isolated environment protected through authentication and access control.
  Visual clarity never compromises data safety or user trust.
</p>

<p>
  Orbit is currently under <span class="u">active development</span>. Future
  improvements will focus on smarter navigation, controlled sharing, and intelligent
  organization—always guided by simplicity and usability.
